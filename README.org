* Utilities for Mac App launchers

- =mktrampoline= :: Create a “trampoline” launcher app

** mktrampoline

This creates a “trampoline” launcher app which is a simple wrapper application that just launches your actual application.

#+begin_src shell
$ nix run github:hraban/apputil -- mktrampoline /path/to/MyApp.app /Applications/MyApp.app
#+end_src

Intuitively, you would either fully copy & paste the original .app, or create a symlink or “alias”; all of those solutions have different problems and they don’t get indexed by Spotlight properly.

This trampoline script is indexed by Spotlight and by Launchpad, so you can keep launching your apps using =⌘ SPC <appname> ⏎=
